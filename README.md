Section B: React JS (Feel Free to use any other JS stack to solve this)
Task 1: Creating the folder structure
Given a JSON tree with leaf nodes as an array. Represent it in the form of a folder structure where upper nodes act as folders and leaf nodes act as files.
There should be a clear distinction between the folders and files, and the interaction on folders should work properly (i.e. clicking on arrow should hide/show the child folders and files)
Each subfolder should be indented accordingly to its depth in the tree, a user should be able to Create/Edit/Delete a file or folder to the user's desired location.

Task2: Lazy Loading To Avoid Pagination

To avoid pagination, Frontend devs came up with the solution of lazy loading, so when a user reaches the end of the page, more results are automatically loaded to have a good user experience.
Note: Please make sure you only use publicly available API

Avoid using any libraries.
Generate any random data, after the user reaches the end of the current results.
